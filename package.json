If you like the look of the new Windows but don't want to have to upgrade your operating system, this app provides a convenient alternative. There is a helpful tutorial that pops up when you first install WinMetro that gives you a good overview of the features of the interface and where to find everything. The WinMetro home screen has the tiled look of Windows 8 and uses the same colors. Clicking on one of the tiles opens the respective program, and there are icons for Menu, Power, and to close the app in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. If you want to switch back to your normal desktop without closing WinMetro, you can just move your mouse to the lower left-hand corner of the screen and click the icon that pops up. Switching back and forth this way is quite convenient, and can make it more efficient for you to find certain kinds of programs. WinMetro will work with Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP, so no matter how old your operating system is, you should have no trouble giving it a facelift. The tiles that populate the home screen of the app include links to your calendar and clock, photos, Internet Explorer, Bing, maps, skydrive, Facebook, Twitter, sports, news, weather, and more. Overall, this is a fun app to try if you're ready to try out the Windows 8 experience without actually upgrading your system -- and it's free to use. \",\nfilesize: \" 7.39MB \"\n}\n...\n]\n```\n# Controller Structure\n```\nexports.scraper = {\n    page: 0,                //starting page\n    limit: 10,              //limit max page per execution\n    name:'SITE NAME',\n    url: 'SITE URL',\n    setup:function(){\n      // will call before scraping starting\n    },\n    finish:function(){\n      // will call after scraping finished\n    },\n    getPagingUrl: function($) {\n      // should return a paging url format, you can replace page number with #pagenumber, so loop can auto goto next page\n      // example http://eshop.com/page/#pagenumber/\n    },\n    nextPage: function(url) {\n  \t\tthis.page++;\t\n  \t\tif(this.page>this.limit){\n  \t\t\treturn false;\n  \t\t}\n      //you can also check if page valid then return false, if nextPage return false ,looping will stoped\n      \n  \t\treturn url.replace('#pagenumber',this.page);      \n    },\n    list: function($) {\n        // expected return an array that contain product/item url on  page/category page\n    },\n    fields: {\n      //define fileds here, each field need function that can return right value\n      //example\n      title:function($){\n        return $('title').text();\n      }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n#Author\nluklukaha@gmail.com\n",
